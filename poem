The sun has krept low and laid its head to sleep
Not a mouse, nor a patron makes a peep
But the lights still shine
Through the daily window brine
Of the St. Albert Hall Library

And in the library one woman is sat
Her skin is fair and freckled
Red hair on her head lays flat. 
Ather desk she wiles away
Until the witching hour when she may
Introduce a tome or two
To a patron of libraries just a little bit not like you

You see she is the night librarian
Shee mans the desk all through the night
For worried college students, working mothers
She is their only respite
But even then these mortals go
And who is left at the library to show?

They did not trust her all at once
She was new and young
Trust was something that must be proven
And so for a time she did not know to whom 
She was the librarian

She did not see underneath a desk
Up on the third floor a gnome did his best
To learn his ancient runes 
by the light of a full moon

Nor at first was she privy
To the many vampires study
In the rafters of the archive
Trying to find their great-great-grandchildren
Warm blooded and alive

She was given three full moon cycles
Until he came with his withered cap
And at the same study carrel he did sat
Mr. Lunard, the closest of them all
To a mortal's simple thrall
It is Mr. Lunard who does decide
If the night librarian does abide
By their rules of secrecy
And so he introduces himself to she

He shows her speculative bespectacled face
The droves of fairies that make haste 
To read through every issue of vanity fair
Allure, and glamour, on the shelves there

He introduces her too, to the creature
Of the black lagoon who squelches and belches
And oozes up through the bathroom pipes
Each midnight to get his delight
Of all that is in the chemistry texts
He’ll glurg and bubble next to an old wise woman
 in a great black hat who is blind 
and has riddles read to her by her cat

She takes all this in her stride
And from the night is determined to be the guide
To all these nighttime patrons who
Just want to read a book or two
She scours the web and shelves by day
To see just what she may find
 for her coven of witches who have their meetings
Every tuesday at the rowan table in the back

She gladly heaves the many tomes of philosophy
To the small corner where a withered banshee
Cackles with maniacal glee over
Homer, aristotle, and nietzsche

And on Fridays before they close
And she may wander off to bed
As the sun rose
Mr. Lunard will share with her a cup of tea
Before bading
“Night Librarian, good morning sleep well
I’ll call again monday after the moon’s swell.”
